This method demonstrates how data was collected from journalistic articles about AI (1960-2024) from the NexisUni and Delpher databases within the NWO-funded PhD programme “The framing of a system technology – Narratives and representations of artificial intelligence in Dutch journalistic media”. 
The project is a collaboration between Utrecht University and Fontys Journalism. The method shows a first step towards extracting quotes (what sources say within a journalistic text production) in journalistic articles. The method was designed by lecturer-researcher and PhD candidate Jessy de Cooker. Thanks to Chris Newell (BBC), Anna Vissens (The Guardian), Jeroen van de Nieuwenhof (Tolkie) and Chris van der Lee (Tilburg University) for their journalistic and technical advice and for sharing their insights, and Danielle Arets (Fontys Journalism) and Bruce Mutsvairo and Imar de Vries (Utrecht University) for their guidance in this PhD programme.
